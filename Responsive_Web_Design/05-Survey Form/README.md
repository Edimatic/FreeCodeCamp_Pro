Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

User Stories:

    You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title
    You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description
    You should have a form element with an id of survey-form
    Inside the form element, you are required to enter your name in an input field that has an id of name and a type of text
    Inside the form element, you are required to enter your email in an input field that has an id of email
    If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error
    Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number
    The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).
    If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
    For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
    For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
    Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
    Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
    Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute
    Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments
