/* Now that the magazine layout is finished, you need to make it responsive.

Start with a @media query for only screen with a max-width of 720px. Inside, create an .image-wrapper selector and give it a grid-template-columns property of 1fr.

This will collapse the three images into one column on smaller screens. */
