/* The images should be within a two column, three row layout.

Give the .image-wrapper selector a grid-template-columns property set to 2fr 1fr and a grid-template-rows property set to repeat(3, min-content). This will give our grid rows that adjust in height based on the content, but columns that remain a fixed width based on the container. */
