/* The gap property is a shorthand way to set the value of column-gap and row-gap at the same time. If given one value, it sets the column-gap and row-gap both to that value. If given two values, it sets the row-gap to the first value and the column-gap to the second.

Give the .image-wrapper selector a gap property set to 2rem */
