<!-- After your header element, create a div with the class set to author.

Within that div, create a p element with the class set to author-name and give it the text By freeCodeCamp. Wrap the freeCodeCamp portion in an a element with the href set to https://freecodecamp.org, and the target set to _blank.

Below that, add a second p element with the class publish-date and the text March 7, 2019.

  <p class="author-name">By
  <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
  </p>
  <p class="publish-date">March 7, 2019</p>
