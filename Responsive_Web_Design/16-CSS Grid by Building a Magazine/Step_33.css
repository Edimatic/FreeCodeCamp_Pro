/* Now you can style the layout of your grid. CSS Grid is similar to Flexbox in that it has a special property for both the parent and child elements.

In this case, your parent element is the main element. Set the content to have a three-column layout by adding a grid-template-columns property with a value of 1fr 94rem 1fr. This will create three columns where the middle column is 94rem wide, and the first and last columns are both 1 fraction of the remaining space in the grid container. */


main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 94rem 1fr;
}
