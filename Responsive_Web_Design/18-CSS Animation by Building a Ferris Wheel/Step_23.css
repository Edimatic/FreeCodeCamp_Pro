/*  With your .wheel selector, you created four different properties to control the animation. For your .cabin selector, you can use the animation property to set these all at once.

Set the animation property of the .cabin rule to cabins 10s linear infinite. This will set the animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, and animation-iteration-count properties in that order. */
