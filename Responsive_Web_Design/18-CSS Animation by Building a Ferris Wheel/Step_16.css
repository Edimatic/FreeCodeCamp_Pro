/*  The @keyframes at-rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation. Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points in the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define the start and end of the sequence.

@keyframes rules require a name to be assigned to them, which you use in other rules to reference. For example, the @keyframes freeCodeCamp { } rule would be named freeCodeCamp.

Time to start animating. Create a @keyframes rule named wheel. */
