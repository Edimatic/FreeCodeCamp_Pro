/*  The transform-origin property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is applied. For example, when performing a rotate (which you will do later in this project), the transform-origin determines around which point the element is rotated.

Give the .line selector a transform-origin property of 0% 0%. This will offset the origin point by 0% from the left and 0% from the top, setting it to the top left corner of the element. */

  width: 50%;
