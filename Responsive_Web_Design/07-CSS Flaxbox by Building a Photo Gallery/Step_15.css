/*  Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:

    row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
    row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
    column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
    column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top

Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.

Try the different values to see how they affect the layout.

When you are done, set an explicit flex-direction of row on the .gallery element. */


.gallery {
  display: flex;
