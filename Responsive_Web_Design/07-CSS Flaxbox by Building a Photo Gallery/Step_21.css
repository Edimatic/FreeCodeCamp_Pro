/* Your images need some space between them.

The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps, also known as gutters, between rows and columns. The gap property and its row-gap and column-gap sub-properties provide this functionality for flex, grid, and multi-column layout. You apply the property to the container element.

Give your .gallery flex container a gap property with 16px as the value. */
