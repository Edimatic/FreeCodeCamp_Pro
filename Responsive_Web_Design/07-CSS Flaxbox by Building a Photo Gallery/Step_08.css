/* Notice how the blue image border extends beyond the red gallery border. This is due to the way browsers calculate the size of container elements.

The box-sizing property is used to set this behavior. By default, the content-box model is used. With this model, when an element has a specific width, that width is calculated based only on the element's content. Padding and border values get added to the total width, so the element grows to accommodate these values.

Try setting box-sizing to content-box explicitly, with the global * selector. At this point, you will not see any changes, because you are using the default value. */
