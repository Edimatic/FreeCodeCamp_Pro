/*  Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout that can control the way items are spaced out and aligned within a container.

To use it, give an element a display property of flex. This will make the element a flex container. Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.

Create a .gallery selector and make it a flex container. */


.gallery {
  display: flex;
}
